# verisign<br>
> Purpose is to export list of domains from Verisign<br>
<br>
Purpose of <b>get-verisign-zones.py</b> script is to export domains from Verisign<br>
<br>

You can see the documentation here, [Verisign REST API Swagger](https://mdns.verisign.com/rest/rest-doc/index.html)

This script exports all domains.  Before using it, you'll need to edit the <b><i>apikey</b></i> and <b><i>account_id</b></i> variables.  See detailed information below in the <b>Usage Example</b> section.<br>
<br>
I suggest that you use a read-only API user as a best practice.<br>
<br>

## Installation & Dependencies

Python 3.6 installed<br>
<br>
The following modules installed:<br>
1.  json<br>
2.  requests<br>
<br>

## Usage example

To run this from command line:<br>
<br>
```sh
./get-verisign-zones.py
```
<br>
These are configurable items in the script:
<br>
<b>1.  Proxy Information:</b><br>
<br>
<br>
The script assumes you don't need to go through a proxy.  If you have a proxy setup at work, then edit the variables section of the script and put in the correct proxy for <b><i>http_proxy</i></b> & <b><i>https_proxy</i></b>.<br>
<br>
You will also need to change this line in the script from:<br>

```sh
verify=False
```

to

```sh
proxies=proxyDict, verify=False
```

<b>2.  Number of pages:</b><br>
<br>
<br>
The script assumes that you have 10,000 or less zones with Verisign.  They limit the return results to 500 per page.  Increase the enumerate number from 21 to allow you to export all zones.  For example, if you have 15,000 zones change 21 to 31.<br>
<br>
Change the number 21 in this line in script:<br>

```sh
h = enumerate(range(1, 21), 1)
```
