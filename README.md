Purpose of script is to export domains from Verisign<br>
<br>
You can see the documentation for their REST API.  Note, I find that the documentation is only viewable on Firefox and Chrome.  It doesn't work with Safari for my system.

[Verisign REST API Swagger](https://mdns.verisign.com/rest/rest-doc/index.html)

<br>This script exports active domains.  You can adjust the results by modifying the <b><i>fields</i></b> variable.  See detailed information below in the <b>Usage Example</b> section.<br>
<br>
If your company requires two factor authentication, you can ask your Mark Monitor account rep to create a read-only API user account that won't require 2FA.<br>
<br>
I suggest that you use a read-only API user as a best practice.<br>
<br>

## Installation & Dependencies

Python 3.6 installed<br>
<br>
The following modules installed:<br>
1.  getpass<br>
2.  json<br>
3.  requests<br>
<br>

## Usage example

To run this from command line:<br>
<br>
```sh
./get-mark_monitor-data.py
```
<br>

The script performs these 4 things:<br>
1.  Creates a session
2.  Login with username/password and get a cookie
3.  Search for all domains with specific status
4.  Log out

These are configurable items in the script:
<br>
<b>1.  Proxy Information:</b><br>
<br>
<br>
The script assumes you don't need to go through a proxy.  If you have a proxy setup at work, then edit the variables section of the script and put in the correct proxy for <b><i>http_proxy</i></b> & <b><i>https_proxy</i></b>.<br>
<br>
You will also need to change three lines of the script from:<br>
```sh
verify=False
```
to<br>
```sh
proxies=proxyDict, verify=False
```

<br>
<b>2.  Search data used:</b><br>
<br>
The script adds the domain to the output file if the value is one of these:<br>
<br>
1.  abandoned<br>
2.  registered locked<br>
3.  registered unlocked<br>
4.  registrar hold<br>
5.  registered premium locked<br>
6.  registered super locked<br><br>

To view the complete list of possible domain statuses, look at [Mark Monitor Domain Statuses](https://domains.markmonitor.com/domains/setup/restapi/#!/Domain/findDomainById)

<br>If you want to adjust the domains returned, edit the <b><i>fields</i></b> variable.<br>
